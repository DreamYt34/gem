  <h1>Video Games is not all bad, Because scientists have proven that video games can increase hand to eye coordination without looking at hands for once! </h1>  
<h2>Video games have also proven to be the best way for introverts to connect, because they spend so much time indoors that it is highly likely for them to start playing video games.</h2>
  <h3>It's considered somewhat common knowledge that video games are good for your hand-eye coordination. A study by the University of Toronto in 2014 indicated that those who play action-intense video games were able to learn sensorimotor skills more readily. On a certain level, this makes perfect sense.</h3>
